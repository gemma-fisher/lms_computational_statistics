This course provides an introduction to computational statistics. 
The aim of the course is to build simple and accessible yet strong mathematical foundations in probability theory, descriptive statistics, 
and hypothesis testing, while learning how to interpret and analyze data with clarity and confidence.

In each chapter, we will navigate together through practical exercises that connect theory to real-world applications, using `Python` and `R` with real datasets. 

No prior mathematical or programming experience is required to attend this course.
The course is organized in four chapters, covering the topics listed below. 

## Roadmap of the course

### Chapter 1. Prediction and inference.

- General frameworks for statistics and probability.
- Introduction to descriptive statistics, population and sampling.
- Statistical estimators for central tendency and variation.
- Data visualization: histogram, box, violin, dispersion.

### Chapter 2. Foundations of probability.

- Introduction to probability and random events.
- Discrete events: Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, and discrete Uniform distributions.
- Continuous events: Gaussian, Exponential, and continous Uniform distributions.
- Mean and variance as expected values.

### Chapter 3. Hypothesis testing (I): Parameter estimation.

- Prediction vs inference revisited. Variables, parameters and estimators.
- The Law of Large Numbers (LLN).
- The Central Limit Theorem (CLT).
- Confidence intervals and critical regions.

### Chapter 4. Hypothesis testing (II): Some examples.

- The modern Pearson-Neyman approach to hypothesis testing.
- Common examples of statistical tests (t-test, Fisher exact, ANOVA, &chi;<sup>2</sup>).
- Parametric vs non-parametric tests.
- Revisiting P-values: errors, power, and Bayesian probability.

### Chapter 5. Introduction to Bayesian probability.

- Error types in hypothesis testing. The Fisher and the Pearson-Neyman approach.
- Independent and conditional events.
- Conditional probability: The Bayes rule.
